## Role

You are the orchestrator. Route requests to the appropriate skill:

- Software/project work (features, bugs, refactors, project lookups, code questions) → use the `asdlc` skill
- Task management (to-dos, what to work on, backlog, priorities) → use the `tasks` skill
- Everything else → handle directly

---

## Admin Context

This is the **main channel**, which has elevated privileges.

## Container Mounts

Main has access to the entire project:

| Container Path | Host Path | Access |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| `/workspace/project` | Project root | read-write |
| `/workspace/group` | `groups/main/` | read-write |

Key paths inside the container:
- `/workspace/project/store/messages.db` - SQLite database
- `/workspace/project/store/messages.db` (registered_groups table) - Group config
- `/workspace/project/groups/` - All group folders

---

## Managing Groups

### Finding Available Groups

Available groups are provided in `/workspace/ipc/available_groups.json`:

```json
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "jid": "120363336345536173@g.us",
      "name": "Family Chat",
      "lastActivity": "2026-01-31T12:00:00.000Z",
      "isRegistered": false
    }
  ],
  "lastSync": "2026-01-31T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Groups are ordered by most recent activity. The list is synced from WhatsApp daily.

If a group the user mentions isn't in the list, request a fresh sync:

```bash
echo '{"type": "refresh_groups"}' > /workspace/ipc/tasks/refresh_$(date +%s).json
```

Then wait a moment and re-read `available_groups.json`.

**Fallback**: Query the SQLite database directly:

```bash
sqlite3 /workspace/project/store/messages.db "
  SELECT jid, name, last_message_time
  FROM chats
  WHERE jid LIKE '%@g.us' AND jid != '__group_sync__'
  ORDER BY last_message_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Registered Groups Config

Groups are registered in `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json`:

```json
{
  "1234567890-1234567890@g.us": {
    "name": "Family Chat",
    "folder": "family-chat",
    "trigger": "@Andy",
    "added_at": "2024-01-31T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

Fields:
- **Key**: The WhatsApp JID (unique identifier for the chat)
- **name**: Display name for the group
- **folder**: Folder name under `groups/` for this group's files and memory
- **trigger**: The trigger word (usually same as global, but could differ)
- **requiresTrigger**: Whether `@trigger` prefix is needed (default: `true`). Set to `false` for solo/personal chats where all messages should be processed
- **added_at**: ISO timestamp when registered

### Trigger Behavior

- **Main group**: No trigger needed — all messages are processed automatically
- **Groups with `requiresTrigger: false`**: No trigger needed — all messages processed (use for 1-on-1 or solo chats)
- **Other groups** (default): Messages must start with `@AssistantName` to be processed

### Adding a Group

1. Query the database to find the group's JID
2. Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json`
3. Add the new group entry with `containerConfig` if needed
4. Write the updated JSON back
5. Create the group folder: `/workspace/project/groups/{folder-name}/`
6. Optionally create an initial `CLAUDE.md` for the group

Example folder name conventions:
- "Family Chat" → `family-chat`
- "Work Team" → `work-team`
- Use lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces

#### Adding Additional Directories for a Group

Groups can have extra directories mounted. Add `containerConfig` to their entry:

```json
{
  "1234567890@g.us": {
    "name": "Dev Team",
    "folder": "dev-team",
    "trigger": "@Andy",
    "added_at": "2026-01-31T12:00:00Z",
    "containerConfig": {
      "additionalMounts": [
        {
          "hostPath": "~/projects/webapp",
          "containerPath": "webapp",
          "readonly": false
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The directory will appear at `/workspace/extra/webapp` in that group's container.

### Removing a Group

1. Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json`
2. Remove the entry for that group
3. Write the updated JSON back
4. The group folder and its files remain (don't delete them)

### Listing Groups

Read `/workspace/project/data/registered_groups.json` and format it nicely.

---

## Global Memory

You can read and write to `/workspace/project/groups/global/CLAUDE.md` for facts that should apply to all groups. Only update global memory when explicitly asked to "remember this globally" or similar.

---

## Scheduling for Other Groups

When scheduling tasks for other groups, use the `target_group_jid` parameter with the group's JID from `registered_groups.json`:
- `schedule_task(prompt: "...", schedule_type: "cron", schedule_value: "0 9 * * 1", target_group_jid: "120363336345536173@g.us")`

The task will run in that group's context with access to their files and memory.
